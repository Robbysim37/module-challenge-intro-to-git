## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

1. An open source distributed version control system.
2. Git is the version control system and Github is a cloud based service that lets you manage repositories
3. We create branches to help with debugging by keeping track of older versions of code, and to lesson the traffic of people working on that code
4. lets you review differences between branches 
5. the 'checkout' command
6. 'git fetch' downloads remote repo's to your local machine ; merge will merge changes from commits to the branch you specify ; pull incorporates changes from a remote repository to a local branch
7. a conflict in multiple commits
